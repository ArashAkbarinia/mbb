# Introduction to Deep learning
The teaching material for the deep learning course taught at the Mind, [Brain and Behaviour Master 
programme](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/mbb?set_language=de) taught
at JLU Giessen.

Instructor: [Arash Akbarinia](https://arashakbarinia.github.io/)


## 1. [Setting up a deep learning environment](tutorials/environment_setup.md)

The prerequisite to continue with the rest of the materials is to set up a deep learning 
environment. This tutorial, we see how to do that using virtual environments.

## 2. [Basic operations in artificial neural networks](notebooks/basic_operations.ipynb)

Artificial neural networks consist of basic operations, such as convolution, pooling, and activation 
functions. In this session we cover those operations.

 * [Assignment 1](notebooks/assignment1.ipynb)


## 3. [Building a deep neural network project](notebooks/build_DNN_project.ipynb)

In this session we create a complete DNN project by constructing our own architecture and dataset.
We train our network for a simple classification problem.

 * [Assignment 2](notebooks/assignment2.ipynb)


## 3. [Optimisation and learning](notebooks/optimisation_learning.ipynb)

In this session we learn how a network acquire its knowledge and tune its weights to perform a certain task.
We train our network for binary classification of a toy example.
